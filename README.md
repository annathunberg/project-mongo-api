# Mongo API Project

First project working with a database. Modeled data in Mongodb using Mongoose. Used my own data from the previous weeks express api.

## Features

- Seeded data
- The API has 2 routes.
- The first endpoint returns an array of elements (all seasons and it's data) /seasons
- The second endpoint returns a single element (a specific season and it's data) /season:season
